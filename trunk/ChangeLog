2010-03-01	ntpmon@libertysys.com.au	0.1.3
	* Correct problem where some columns are skipped entirely if they
	  contain invalid data.

2010-02-28	ntpmon@libertysys.com.au	0.1.2
	* SLES 10 requires ENV to be untainted as well as PATH.
	* Add some extra explanations to the README.
	* Skip peers which are in .INIT. state - these have never worked.  It
	  is common for a host's own IP to be included as a peer (for
	  consistency of configuration), and it will always appear in the
	  .INIT. state, so NTPmon counts this as a non-error.
	* When there is no data to be displayed (usually when a host has just
	  been added for collection), NTPmon now skips it, eliminating noise
	  error messages in the apache error log.
	* Minor fixes in graph display.
	* Improved installation process.
	* Ownership of the RRD databases & images now regularly (every 5
	  minutes by default) changed to the apache user.

2010-02-28	ntpmon@libertysys.com.au	0.1.1
	* Do not log data for stats which are not valid for the interval.  This
	  creates gaps in the graphs rather than ugly drops to zero and back.
	* Add min, avg, and max figures for the interval to the peer count and
	  time offset graphs.
	* Warn instead of die if a host RRD cannot be created or updated.  If
	  there is a problem with just one host's database, the collector
	  will now continue instead of failing on the first bad host.
	* Changed offset graph to milliseconds as it was pre-0.1.

2010-02-27	ntpmon@libertysys.com.au	0.1
	* Initial release
